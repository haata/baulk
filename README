// Baulk ******************************************************************************************

Baulk is a cross-platform native application tiling management tool written in Qt4. An emphasis is made on making all major components a separate dynamic library, for modularity.


Baulk is a complete rewrite of QuillTex (also written by me, which was in its third complete rewrite).
At current QuillTex is far more usable, and has WAY more working features, mind you only in Linux.
You can find QuillTex at http://quilltex.sf.net, and currently the SVN source is lightyears ahead of the released version. It has a plethora of features above the release, and a plethora of bugs to go with it. 
The released version has very few bugs.
